# Projects

There are the projects I've done and published. You may be wondering: why so many projects? Are they all still maintained?

The reason for so much project is that specific needs arose that I didn't find other suitable solutions for those needs, or I didn't look hard enough. Some of these projects are just experiments and have no commercial intention in the beginning, so don't expect everyone here to be maintained.

Some of the projects below are very simple things that don't require periodic maintenance, but if they have a **Maintained** status, it's because they will receive bug fixes, if there's any. Archived projects are abandoned and should not be used.
